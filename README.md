# 🌱 Natural Computer by 3dvr.tech

A project to design and prototype a real computer made from natural components.

## 🌍 Vision
We believe computing can be reimagined using materials from nature — wood, algae, moss, mycelium, water, and light — to create devices that are sustainable, open-source, and repairable.

## 🚧 Goals
- Create simple natural logic gates (e.g. slime mold, fluidic, mechanical).
- Store information using natural methods (DNA, magnetite, visible markers).
- Power circuits using living systems (moss, thermoelectric, photosynthesis).
- Design modular and repairable eco-computers.

## 🧪 Current Focus
- Testing moss-based bio-batteries.
- Conductive ink circuits on wood and paper.
- Growing mycelium chassis for components.

## 🤝 Contribute
We welcome artists, biologists, engineers, and curious humans to explore this path with us. Let’s build something alive and open.
